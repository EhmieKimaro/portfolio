        <h2>Portfolio Details</h2>
        <p>TasteBridge is a mobile platform designed to help Nigerian immigrants in Brighton discover authentic ingredients, local shops, and culturally relevant food experiences. The project aimed to bridge the emotional and practical gap between culture and accessibility through human-centered design.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Design Thinking Process: TasteBridge - A Community-Powered Ingredient Platform for the Nigerian Diaspora in Brighton</h4> 
        <br>
        <p><b>1. Empathize - Understanding the Cultural and Emotional Context:</b> Conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 participants (consumers, vendors, restaurant owners) and social media ethnography across TikTok and WhatsApp groups. Discovered deep emotional pain points tied to cultural disconnection, ingredient scarcity, trust issues, and naming confusion (e.g., “pumpkin leaves” vs. “ugu”).
        Mapped qualitative data into affinity diagrams and personas to capture both user frustrations and cultural aspirations.</p>

        <p><b>2. Define - Synthesizing Insights into Opportunities:</b> Identified 14 major pain points, including price inflation, unreliable delivery, and a lack of trusted digital platforms. Developed POV statements and How Might We questions, such as:
        “How might we help Nigerians in Brighton access authentic ingredients while staying connected to their food heritage?”. Defined the design challenge as: “Creating a trusted, community-driven ingredient discovery platform that celebrates cultural identity while simplifying access.”</p>

        <p><b>3. Ideate - Co-creating with the Community:</b> Led brainstorming and evaluation workshops, generating 20+ potential features. Used an idea evaluation matrix to prioritize high-impact, feasible solutions. Conducted a feature prioritization survey (N=21) — resulting in the top MVP features:

        1. Ingredient Finder (with camera scan)
        2. Local Nigerian shops/restaurants in Brighton
        3. Vendor directory (UK and Nigeria-based)
        4. Peer Connect (community courier system)</p>

        <p><b>4. Prototype - Turning Ideas into Tangible Experiences:</b> Designed low-fidelity wireframes in Miro to test structure and user flow. Designed high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, integrating a clean cultural aesthetic with functional clarity. Key flows included ingredient search, vendor listings, and peer-to-peer delivery coordination. Designed for both emotional resonance (nostalgia, trust) and usability (clear hierarchy, minimal friction).</p>

        <p><b>5. Test - Iterative Validation and Refinement:</b> Conducted three rounds of usability testing (6 participants). Iterated designs based on feedback around navigation clarity, visual hierarchy, and feature accessibility. Achieved 91% positive feedback on the statement: “This app would help me feel more connected to Nigerian food culture in Brighton.” Key insights led to simplified navigation, lighter color palette, and clearer trust indicators.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p><b>Outcome & Impact</b>
        <br>
        <p>Validated that culturally attuned UX can foster belonging and trust among diaspora users. Developed actionable design recommendations for inclusive, diaspora-centered digital products. Demonstrated how UX design can preserve cultural identity through digital community experiences.</p>

        <p><b>Tools & Methods:</b>

        Figma · Miro · Google Forms · Affinity Mapping · SWOT Analysis · MVP Validation Survey · Iterative Usability Testing.</p>
